# Beast

## Game description

I want recreate the game [Beast](https://dosgames.com/game/beast/).

### Core mechanics

- The player is controlled by the arrow keys. 
- A certain number of Beasts move around the board, trying to eat the player. 
- Blocks can be pushed. If a block is pushed into another block, the whole stack can 
  be pushed. However, there are some immovable blocks, and blocks can't be pushed into immovable blocks.
  If a stack of one or more blocks is pushed into a beast, and there's a block behind the beast, 
  it will be squished. If there isn't a block behind the beast, the beast can't be pushed. 
- The goal of the game is to squish all the beasts.

## Challenges

I can foresee two challenges in this game:
- How will I program interactions between players, blocks, and beasts?
- How do I get the beasts to chase the player?
